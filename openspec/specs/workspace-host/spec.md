# workspace-host Specification

## Purpose
Provide durable, provider-independent project, ticket and agent ownership and message routing in a headless Rust host.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Enforced hierarchy
The host SHALL allow projects without repositories, require each ticket to reference a repository its project uses, and require workers to belong to the project coordinator of the same project and to work on one of its tickets. Multiple tickets SHALL share a repository.

#### Scenario: Invalid worker owner
- **WHEN** a worker is created under a session from another project, or a repository coordinator is created
- **THEN** the host rejects creation without persisting a partial assignment

### Requirement: Durable ordered messages
The host SHALL persist bounded messages before acknowledging queue acceptance, deduplicate stable IDs, reject changed payloads under an existing ID, preserve recipient ordering, paginate transcripts and distinguish queued, delivered, acknowledged and completed receipts.

#### Scenario: Restart and duplicate send
- **WHEN** the host restarts after accepting a message and that message is submitted again
- **THEN** exactly one local record remains and its receipt remains observable

### Requirement: Recovery and attention
The host SHALL retain pending attention bound to the originating operation and allow one terminal answer. Worker blocked state SHALL remain independent from attention. Working sessions SHALL recover as disconnected, with ambiguous accepted work held for reconciliation.

#### Scenario: Replayed approval response
- **WHEN** a resolved request receives another answer after restart
- **THEN** the stale answer is rejected and the original resolution is preserved

### Requirement: Portable local command boundary
The host SHALL expose versioned bounded commands over JSON-lines and build without GPUI. Database ownership SHALL be exclusive per store.

#### Scenario: Competing host
- **WHEN** another process attempts to open an already owned store
- **THEN** it fails visibly instead of becoming a competing writer

### Requirement: Assignment tools take an exact model and reason
The `assign_ticket` MCP tool SHALL require a `profile` (provider, model, effort) and a one-line `reason` in place of `provider`, `size` and `complexity`. Its other arguments SHALL be unchanged. Calls that still send `size`, `complexity` or `provider` SHALL fail with a message naming the replacement. A call for an agent that already exists SHALL return it unchanged, without checking or switching its model.

#### Scenario: Old size argument
- **WHEN** the coordinator calls `assign_ticket` with `size: "big"`
- **THEN** the call fails, saying to choose an exact profile within the role's providers, and no agent is created

#### Scenario: Existing assignment is not switched
- **WHEN** the coordinator repeats `assign_ticket` for an existing role and focus with a different profile
- **THEN** the existing agent is returned with its original profile

### Requirement: The coordinator receives the model configuration
`workspace_context` SHALL give the project coordinator the enabled providers with their allowed models, the providers per role, the configured verifiers and the guide, read fresh on each call. Workers SHALL NOT receive them.

#### Scenario: Configuration edit reaches a running coordinator
- **WHEN** the human adds Codex to the Implementer role while the project coordinator is idle
- **THEN** its next `workspace_context` call shows Implementer using Claude and Codex, with the new revision

### Requirement: No turn limits
The host SHALL NOT limit how many turns run at once, in a project or across the host, and SHALL NOT pause a project or stop a turn because of how many turns it has run. A session with due input SHALL start a turn unless it is paused, disconnected, held, already in a turn, waiting for its ticket's worktree, or a verifier whose round has not been admitted. Sessions that cannot start SHALL NOT keep the scheduler from reaching those that can, however many messages they have queued. A stored project that still records a turn limit SHALL load, and the value SHALL be ignored and not reported.

#### Scenario: Many workers at once
- **WHEN** nine workers across two projects each have due input and nothing holds them
- **THEN** all nine turns start in the same scheduling pass

#### Scenario: Long-running project keeps going
- **WHEN** a project's sessions have run 150 turns since the human last stepped in
- **THEN** the project stays live and its next due turn starts

#### Scenario: Old store
- **WHEN** a stored project's data contains `"turn_limit": 4`
- **THEN** the project loads, and neither `workspace_context` nor the snapshot reports a turn limit

#### Scenario: Paused coordinator with a long queue
- **WHEN** the project coordinator is paused with 101 queued messages and a worker in the same project has due input
- **THEN** the scheduler reaches the worker in the same pass

### Requirement: Check-ins keep parents informed
The host SHALL tell a session's parent about long or repetitive work, and SHALL never pause or stop work for it. Each check-in SHALL be a durable message from the session to its parent whose body starts with `[check-in]`, names the session, its ticket if any, and recent activity, and says how to stop it with `stop_agents`. A check-in SHALL wake the parent, also while the session's ticket is being verified, and SHALL NOT count as a report or a verdict.
- **Time:** when a turn has run 30 minutes, and every 30 minutes after while it runs, the parent SHALL receive a check-in naming the elapsed time, the last provider event and the latest step.
- **Turn count:** when a session with a parent starts its Nth turn since its parent last sent it a message, where N is the `checkin_child_turns` setting, and at every further multiple of N, the parent SHALL receive a check-in naming the turn count, when the parent last messaged it, and the start of the session's last reply.
- **Human:** a session without a parent, the project coordinator, SHALL raise a human inbox item instead of a message: for its own 30-minute turns, cleared when a newer one is raised or the turn ends; and when it starts its Mth turn since the human last stepped in anywhere in the project, where M is the `checkin_human_turns` setting, and at every further multiple of M, cleared when the human next steps in or a newer one is raised. The human steps in by sending any session of the project a message, answering or resolving any of its inbox items, including permission requests, or retrying any of its sessions' input.
A host restart SHALL clear open time check-ins, and the human's turn count SHALL start again from zero.

#### Scenario: Thirty-minute check-in
- **WHEN** a tester's turn has run 30 minutes
- **THEN** its parent receives a `[check-in]` message naming the tester, its ticket, "30 minutes" and its latest step, and the turn keeps running

#### Scenario: Twenty-five turns without the parent
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25 and an implementer starts its 25th turn since its parent last messaged it
- **THEN** its parent receives one `[check-in]` naming the implementer, its ticket and "25 turns", and the turn runs
- **AND** the 26th turn sends no check-in, and the 50th sends another

#### Scenario: Parent message resets the count
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25, an implementer has run 24 turns, its parent sends it a message, and it runs 24 more
- **THEN** its parent has received no turn-count check-in

#### Scenario: Coordinator runs 100 turns without the human
- **WHEN** `checkin_human_turns` is 100 and the project coordinator starts its 100th turn since the human last stepped in
- **THEN** the human's inbox gains one item naming the coordinator and the turn count, the project stays live and the turn runs
- **AND** the item stays open after that turn ends, and the human's next message to the coordinator clears it

#### Scenario: Turn-count check-in during a round
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25 and a verifier starts its 25th turn without a message from its parent while its ticket's cycle is running
- **THEN** the project coordinator wakes with the check-in, and the ticket's state and verification record are unchanged

### Requirement: Check-in thresholds are host settings
The host's `settings.json` SHALL hold `checkin_child_turns` and `checkin_human_turns` beside `verification`. Settings saved without them SHALL use 25 and 100. A `set_check_ins` command SHALL save both; it SHALL refuse a child threshold outside 5–500 or a human threshold outside 10–1000, keeping the saved values, and SHALL keep other settings and unknown fields. A saved change SHALL apply from the next turn that starts, without a restart.

#### Scenario: Settings saved before this change
- **WHEN** `settings.json` has a workspace folder and verification but no check-in thresholds
- **THEN** the host reads 25 and 100, and the verification setting is unchanged

#### Scenario: Lower child threshold
- **WHEN** the human saves `checkin_child_turns` 10 and an implementer then starts its 10th turn since its parent last messaged it
- **THEN** its parent receives a turn-count check-in naming "10 turns"

#### Scenario: Out of range
- **WHEN** `set_check_ins` is called with a child threshold of 4 or a human threshold of 1001
- **THEN** it is refused and the saved thresholds stay in effect

### Requirement: Host messages come from Wiffletree
Messages the host sends without a sender, such as a verification round's or cycle's result, a kept-worktree notice, a migration notice or a PR watcher message, SHALL be labelled as coming from Wiffletree: the recipient's turn input SHALL name the sender "Wiffletree", or "Wiffletree PR watcher" for the PR watcher, and the conversation view SHALL show them as Wiffletree notices. Messages the human sends, including answers to inbox items, SHALL keep the human label.

#### Scenario: Verification result
- **WHEN** a verification cycle ends and the coordinator's next turn includes its result
- **THEN** that message's sender reads "Wiffletree", not "human", and the chat shows it as a Wiffletree notice

#### Scenario: The human's message
- **WHEN** the human sends the coordinator a message
- **THEN** its sender still reads "human" and the chat shows it as the human's

### Requirement: A running turn shows as working
A session whose turn is running SHALL show the status `working` in the snapshot and in `workspace_context`, even after it reported `blocked`, `failed`, `ready_for_testing` or `completed` during that turn. The reported status SHALL still be stored and SHALL show once the turn ends. After a host restart, no turn SHALL show as running until one starts.

#### Scenario: Blocked report mid-turn
- **WHEN** an implementer reports `blocked` and keeps working in the same turn
- **THEN** the sidebar and `workspace_context` show it as working, and `workspace_context` lists its `blocked` report
- **AND** when the turn ends it shows as blocked
