# workspace-host Specification

## Purpose
Provide durable, provider-independent project, ticket and agent ownership and message routing in a headless Rust host.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Enforced hierarchy
The host SHALL allow projects without repositories, require each ticket to reference a repository its project uses, and require workers to belong to the project coordinator of the same project and to work on one of its tickets. Multiple tickets SHALL share a repository.

#### Scenario: Invalid worker owner
- **WHEN** a worker is created under a session from another project, or a repository coordinator is created
- **THEN** the host rejects creation without persisting a partial assignment

### Requirement: Durable ordered messages
The host SHALL persist bounded messages before acknowledging queue acceptance, deduplicate stable IDs, reject changed payloads under an existing ID, preserve recipient ordering, paginate transcripts and distinguish queued, delivered, acknowledged and completed receipts.

#### Scenario: Restart and duplicate send
- **WHEN** the host restarts after accepting a message and that message is submitted again
- **THEN** exactly one local record remains and its receipt remains observable

### Requirement: Recovery and attention
The host SHALL retain pending attention bound to the originating operation and allow one terminal answer. Worker blocked state SHALL remain independent from attention. Working sessions SHALL recover as disconnected, with ambiguous accepted work held for reconciliation.

#### Scenario: Replayed approval response
- **WHEN** a resolved request receives another answer after restart
- **THEN** the stale answer is rejected and the original resolution is preserved

### Requirement: Portable local command boundary
The host SHALL expose versioned bounded commands over JSON-lines and build without GPUI. Database ownership SHALL be exclusive per store.

#### Scenario: Competing host
- **WHEN** another process attempts to open an already owned store
- **THEN** it fails visibly instead of becoming a competing writer

### Requirement: Assignment tools take an exact model and reason
The `assign_ticket` MCP tool SHALL require a `profile` (provider, model, effort) and a one-line `reason` in place of `provider`, `size` and `complexity`. Its other arguments SHALL be unchanged. Calls that still send `size`, `complexity` or `provider` SHALL fail with a message naming the replacement. A call for an agent that already exists SHALL return it unchanged, without checking or switching its model.

#### Scenario: Old size argument
- **WHEN** the coordinator calls `assign_ticket` with `size: "big"`
- **THEN** the call fails, saying to choose an exact profile within the role's providers, and no agent is created

#### Scenario: Existing assignment is not switched
- **WHEN** the coordinator repeats `assign_ticket` for an existing role and focus with a different profile
- **THEN** the existing agent is returned with its original profile

### Requirement: The coordinator receives the model configuration
`workspace_context` SHALL give the project coordinator the enabled providers with their allowed models, the providers per role, the configured verifiers and the guide, read fresh on each call. Workers SHALL NOT receive them.

#### Scenario: Configuration edit reaches a running coordinator
- **WHEN** the human adds Codex to the Implementer role while the project coordinator is idle
- **THEN** its next `workspace_context` call shows Implementer using Claude and Codex, with the new revision
