# settings-repository Specification

## Purpose
Keeps the settings the human chose to share in one folder on every machine, so a settings repository can carry them between machines.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Shared settings live in one folder on every machine
The host SHALL keep the shared settings in `<data folder>/shared/`, with or without a settings repository: `wiffletree.json` naming the folder's format, `settings/review.json`, `settings/model-guide.md`, `settings/check-ins.json`, `settings/pr-keeper.json`, and `skills/` in the skills layout. All reads and writes SHALL go through one store rooted at that folder, and writes SHALL be atomic. JSON files SHALL be written with sorted keys, and a write SHALL keep fields this release does not know. A missing file SHALL mean that setting's default. At the first start of this release, the host SHALL copy each shared setting that has no file yet from where it was saved, exactly as saved, and SHALL move `<data folder>/skills/` into the shared folder. It SHALL leave the old values in place, no longer read. Nothing SHALL create `logs/` or `tickets/`.

#### Scenario: An update
- **WHEN** Wiffletree starts after an update on a machine whose `settings.json` has check-in thresholds 10 and 300, a keeper with the rebase trigger on, and a verification setting saved before review levels
- **THEN** `settings/check-ins.json` holds 10 and 300, `settings/pr-keeper.json` has the rebase trigger on, `settings/review.json` holds the verifiers and caps without levels and is read as one level "Full", and nothing behaves differently

#### Scenario: The guide moves
- **WHEN** Wiffletree starts after an update on a machine with a saved guide
- **THEN** `settings/model-guide.md` holds the guide exactly as saved, and the coordinator's `workspace_context` shows it unchanged

#### Scenario: A fresh install
- **WHEN** Wiffletree starts for the first time
- **THEN** no shared setting has a file, and every shared setting has its default

#### Scenario: An interrupted move
- **WHEN** the move stopped after writing `settings/review.json` and before the other files
- **THEN** the next start writes the missing files and leaves `settings/review.json` as it is
