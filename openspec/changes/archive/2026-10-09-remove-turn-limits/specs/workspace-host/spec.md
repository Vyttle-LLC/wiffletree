## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: No turn limits
The host SHALL NOT limit how many turns run at once, in a project or across the host, and SHALL NOT pause a project or stop a turn because of how many turns it has run. A session with due input SHALL start a turn unless it is paused, disconnected, held, already in a turn, waiting for its ticket's worktree, or a verifier whose round has not been admitted. A stored project that still records a turn limit SHALL load, and the value SHALL be ignored and not reported.

#### Scenario: Many workers at once
- **WHEN** nine workers across two projects each have due input and nothing holds them
- **THEN** all nine turns start in the same scheduling pass

#### Scenario: Long-running project keeps going
- **WHEN** a project's sessions have run 150 turns since the human last stepped in
- **THEN** the project stays live and its next due turn starts

#### Scenario: Old store
- **WHEN** a stored project's data contains `"turn_limit": 4`
- **THEN** the project loads, and neither `workspace_context` nor the snapshot reports a turn limit

### Requirement: Check-ins keep parents informed
The host SHALL tell a session's parent about long or repetitive work, and SHALL never pause or stop work for it. Each check-in SHALL be a durable message from the session to its parent whose body starts with `[check-in]`, names the session, its ticket if any, and recent activity, and says how to stop it with `stop_agents`. A check-in SHALL wake the parent, also while the session's ticket is being verified, and SHALL NOT count as a report or a verdict.
- **Time:** when a turn has run 30 minutes, and every 30 minutes after while it runs, the parent SHALL receive a check-in naming the elapsed time, the last provider event and the latest step.
- **Turn count:** when a session with a parent starts its Nth turn since its parent last sent it a message, where N is the `checkin_child_turns` setting, and at every further multiple of N, the parent SHALL receive a check-in naming the turn count, when the parent last messaged it, and the start of the session's last reply.
- **Human:** a session without a parent, the project coordinator, SHALL raise a human inbox item instead of a message: for its own 30-minute turns, cleared when a newer one is raised or the turn ends; and when it starts its Mth turn since the human last stepped in anywhere in the project, where M is the `checkin_human_turns` setting, and at every further multiple of M, cleared when the human next steps in or a newer one is raised. The human steps in by sending any session of the project a message, answering or resolving any of its inbox items, including permission requests, or retrying any of its sessions' input.
A host restart SHALL clear open time check-ins, and the human's turn count SHALL start again from zero.

#### Scenario: Thirty-minute check-in
- **WHEN** a tester's turn has run 30 minutes
- **THEN** its parent receives a `[check-in]` message naming the tester, its ticket, "30 minutes" and its latest step, and the turn keeps running

#### Scenario: Twenty-five turns without the parent
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25 and an implementer starts its 25th turn since its parent last messaged it
- **THEN** its parent receives one `[check-in]` naming the implementer, its ticket and "25 turns", and the turn runs
- **AND** the 26th turn sends no check-in, and the 50th sends another

#### Scenario: Parent message resets the count
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25, an implementer has run 24 turns, its parent sends it a message, and it runs 24 more
- **THEN** its parent has received no turn-count check-in

#### Scenario: Coordinator runs 100 turns without the human
- **WHEN** `checkin_human_turns` is 100 and the project coordinator starts its 100th turn since the human last stepped in
- **THEN** the human's inbox gains one item naming the coordinator and the turn count, the project stays live and the turn runs
- **AND** the item stays open after that turn ends, and the human's next message to the coordinator clears it

#### Scenario: Turn-count check-in during a round
- **WHEN** `checkin_child_turns` is 25 and a verifier starts its 25th turn without a message from its parent while its ticket's cycle is running
- **THEN** the project coordinator wakes with the check-in, and the ticket's state and verification record are unchanged

### Requirement: Check-in thresholds are host settings
The host's `settings.json` SHALL hold `checkin_child_turns` and `checkin_human_turns` beside `verification`. Settings saved without them SHALL use 25 and 100. A `set_check_ins` command SHALL save both; it SHALL refuse a child threshold outside 5–500 or a human threshold outside 10–1000, keeping the saved values, and SHALL keep other settings and unknown fields. A saved change SHALL apply from the next turn that starts, without a restart.

#### Scenario: Settings saved before this change
- **WHEN** `settings.json` has a workspace folder and verification but no check-in thresholds
- **THEN** the host reads 25 and 100, and the verification setting is unchanged

#### Scenario: Lower child threshold
- **WHEN** the human saves `checkin_child_turns` 10 and an implementer then starts its 10th turn since its parent last messaged it
- **THEN** its parent receives a turn-count check-in naming "10 turns"

#### Scenario: Out of range
- **WHEN** `set_check_ins` is called with a child threshold of 4 or a human threshold of 1001
- **THEN** it is refused and the saved thresholds stay in effect
